# Spectrum

Spectrum is a Minecraft shaderpack, and is currently in early alpha.  
It aims to provide a "natural" look and feel.

Expect a lot of bugs.

## Requirements

I try to keep Spectrum compatible with most hardware, and as far as I know there are no particular hardware requirements.

* Optifine 1.12.1 HD U C6 (or newer)

## Installation

Installing Spectrum is like installing any other current shaderpack.
If you're new to getting shaders from a GitHub repository, keep in mind that if you download the repository as a .zip you will need to extract the folder within in order for the shaderpack to be detected.
