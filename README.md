# Spectrum

Spectrum is a Minecraft: Java Edition shaderpack, and it is currently in alpha.  
It aims to provide a "natural" look and feel.

[I have a Discord for Spectrum and my other projects.](https://discord.gg/Pj7aXg3)  
[Spectrum is also on the shaderLABS Discord.](https://discord.gg/RpzWN9S)  
[My Twitter that I will probably rarely, if ever, use.](https://twitter.com/ZombyeTweets)

## Requirements

* Hardware and drivers that support OpenGL 4.0
* OptiFine 1.13.2 HD U E5 (or newer)

Note: I currently only have access to Nvidia GPUs for testing.  
Because of this, I cannot ensure that Spectrum will work properly for AMD and Intel GPUs.  
That said, I will still try to fix any issues that occur for AMD and Intel users.
