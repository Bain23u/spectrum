# Spectrum

Spectrum is a Minecraft: Java Edition shaderpack, and is currently in alpha.  
It aims to provide a "natural" look and feel.

## Requirements

* Optifine 1.12.2 HD U C7 (or newer)

## Installation

Installing Spectrum is like installing any other current shaderpack.
If you're new to getting shaderpacks from a GitHub repository, keep in mind that if you download the repository as a .zip you will need to extract the folder within in order for the shaderpack to be detected.
